An explanation for these plot can be found with [my first blog post]({% post_url 2016-02-10-targets-v-results %}).
Essentially, states above the diagonal are where Clinton exceeded targets, below Sanders is exceeding target.
Arbitrarely, positive indicates "Clinton-ness", 0 is neutral and negative is "Sanders-ness".

The targets used are:

- [Cook Political Report, Jan 21](http://cookpolitical.com/story/9179).
- [Cook Political Report, Feb 12](http://cookpolitical.com/story/9258).
- [my first attempt]({% post_url 2016-02-15-targets---FiveThirtyEight-edition %}) (`white*2012 Democratic vote share`)
- [FiveThirtyEight's targets](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanderss-path-to-the-nomination/)
