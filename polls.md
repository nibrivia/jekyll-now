This chart seeks to satisfy some of my more particular desires in charts, as well as add a bit of information.
I am only using the democratic primary race, due to a target analysis that is *significantly* easier to run in a 2-person race.

- better moving average (with std error!)
- plotting empty space for the future
- I don't like percentages much, I significantly prefer [log odds-ratio]({% post_url 2016-02-13-why-I-prefer-log-odds-ratio %})
- plotting the state results after using [targets to correct them for bias]({% post_url 2016-02-12-playing-with-huffpolster %}).

This doesn't tell us much (yet!), but these new points probably tell us something about how the rest of the country is going to vote, assuming nothing changes.
