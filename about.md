**Who am I?**

I am Olivia Brode-Roger, a Political Sciences student at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), 
a Data Analyst Fellow at [iCivics](https://icivics.org) and Chairman of [The Tech](https://thetech.com).

I love to find patterns in our world: the universe is exciting!

Outside of political science, I also enjoy teaching, fire breathing and cheese making.
