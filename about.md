###Who am I?

I am Olivia Brode-Roger, a Political Sciences student at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/).
Before settling on Political Science, I was a Planetary Sciences, then Computer Sciences, then Mathematics major.

I am passionate about trying to understand what causes change in our world, and finding interesting quantitative approaches to the political process.
Especially interesting is the Judiciary, whose power comes almost uniquely from the trust placed in it.

Outside of political science, I also enjoy teaching, fire breathing and cheese making.

###What is this?

I learned [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for a class, and immediately started being interested in doing all kinds of analysis.
Most of them are sparked by reading a news article and either wanting to know more, or being frustrated at the data presented, I then set out to re-create it, but better (in my mind).
